00:00 Laurel: "You are currently waisting it, that could stop tomorrow."
00:05 Patrick: "It could but there are a number of ways that it could happen."
00:15 L: "what do you want? What do you want from me?"
00:18 P: "What I want right now is for you to stop calling me a liar while lying to me."
00:20 L: (Interupting) "Not right now."
00:22 L: "Okay"
00:22 P: "Thats immensely frustrating."
00:23 L: "I want you to stop saying that you know what I meant when you dont."
00:27 P: "I didn't say that I knew what you meant, I said that I knew what you SAID you meant. Just because you don't say what you mean, even when you clarify mean, doesn't make it my fault."
00:38 L: "It does when you wont let me clarify."
00:39 P: "You litterally clarified and then I quoted you and then you were like thats wrong."
00:45 L: "It WAS wrong!"
00:46 P: "It's not my fault that I gave you the option to clarify and then you said the wrong thing!"
00:52 L: "Just because you believe that your life, right now, is you, your entirety as a person, doesn't mean that I have to agree with it, doesn't mean that's what I meant."
01:01 P: "Okay, fine. How is that, how is that NOT the case though?"
01:04 L: "I don't understand (What you are saying)."
01:05 P: "What are you if not your life? A person can't exist outside of/without their life. Explain it to me."
01:19 L: "I'll explain it to you. Life is ever changing (all the time)."
01:24 P: (Interupting) "PEOPLE are also ever changing all the time."
01:30 L: "Okay, fine. You are a waist currently. I believe you could not be a waist. I believe you have potential. I believe you could have a good future. I don't believe you are a waist period. I don't. I do believe you are waisting your life right now. So what do you want me to do? Do you want me to let you lie in bed every day and let you do nothing? Do you want me to just keep treating you like you're twelve? You're just going to stay home and be perpetually twelve? Do you want us to do that with smiles on our faces?"
02:03 P: "Well I wouldn't want you to do it, like, the oposite of smiles."
02:13 L: "We can't do it with smiles on our faces. Thats rediculous. You're not twelve. You're completely capable and you refuse to act like an adult. And you take off every day and you hang out at the college because you have some cash now but when that runs out then you'll still be around staying home. You're acting like a child, because you don't want to. Could you imagine a world full of people, adults that just don't want to..."
02:51 P: "No, I can't imagine a world FULL of people who just don't want to do stuff because those people wouldn't exist and that would be fine because the rest of the planet would move on."
03:03 L: "Do you think that people want to go to work?"
03:06 P: "Some do and some don't."
03:07 L: "Do you think that people want to eat their vegeatables."
03:10 P: "Some do and some don't."
03:11 L: "Do you think people want to do their laundry?
03:13 P: "I mean..."
03:14 L: "Or clean their bathroom? or pay their taxes? I don't know, I think you have a warped sense of reality. If you think that everybody on this planet is doing exactly what they want all the time, thats just not reality."
03:29 P: (Interupting) "All you are telling me is that the stuff that I don't like to do is completely normal to not like to do it. The only part that we disagree on is whether or not it matters."
03:33 L: (Interupting) "Oh God."
03:38 L: (Interupting) "Why are you so, why are you so delicate that you can't be an adult, I don't understand."
03:44 P: "It's not even that I can't, it's that theres no reason to."
03:49 L: "You will suffer if you don't."
03:51 P: "It won't matter, it's suffering either way."
03:53 L: "Okay, so the suffering, the yelling, the being yelled at, the, the, the, (sigh) the anxiety and, and the... trauma between you and your parents, that's not any kind of suffering, and you, thats not anything you would bother to fix at all. I don't understand, what happened because several months back you all of a sudden decided you were getting a job and then you didn't talk about it again. What happened?"
04:23 P: "I don't know."
04:33 L: "So, how do you see this going the next five years?"
04:36 P: "I don't know."
04:37 L: "You don't know? You don't have any plans for yourself? Are you
